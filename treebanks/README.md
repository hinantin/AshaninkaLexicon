### Ashaninka treebanks

In this repository we provide **the Ashaninka text corpus**, a set of labeled resources for different NLP applications, we store in XML format following our own XML Schema definition (XSD) `parallel_texts.xsd`. 

The aforementioned schema asks for texts to be separated in sentences, which we will take as basic units, each sentence will have translations in different languages, as well as different analysis levels (i.e., morphology and parsing), as a result these XML files could be queried using the XQuery Engine of your preference.
